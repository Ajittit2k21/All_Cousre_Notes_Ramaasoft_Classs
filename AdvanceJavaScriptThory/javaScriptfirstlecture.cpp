Javascript
==========
it is a client side scripting language

client side- uses resources of clients machine such as processor and ram

when we open a website
	html,javascript,css pages
	images,audio,video are copied to clients machine and further executed by webbrowser on clients machine

	where as server side scripts such as php,asp,jsp are executed on server machine and their output only is delivered to clients machine

scripting language- a language which is subset of a programming language and used for a specific purpose only(as javascript is subset of programming language java,vbscript is subset of programming language visual basic)

another defination of scripting language is a language which can be used to enhance routines of operating system,
this defination is used in context of shell script,perl script

various client side scripting languages
1.javascript
started by netscape,now managed by ===>Mozila
syntaxes similar to c
it is a w3c compliance rule for browsers to support it,all browsers do support it



2.vbscript
started and maintained by microsoft
syntax similar to vb
no rule for this,only IE supports it


3.jscript
started and maintained by microsoft
syntax similar to c
no rule for this,only IE supports it


why we need client side scripting
1. client side calculation
	calculations in shopping cart such as amount=rate*quantity can be done using javascript
	for checkouts only verified by server side scripting

2. client side validation
	a program is good if it performs correct operations,it may require proper input too

	by pattern
	email address	x@y.c
	rgpv rollno	9999aa999999

	using regular expression(regex)
	using ascii values

	by range
	marks 	0-100
	
	by set
	branch in cse,it,ec,mech only	

xhtml
     html+xml(DOC Type)

3. DHTML
Dynamic HTML, it is related to presentation of content and not generation of content
	image changes on mouse movement
	menu popups on click
	image slideshow

it is combination of html,css,javascript

4. Using Browser properties

identify a browser and its version
identify resolution on clients machine
set a page as homepage(client side)
add a page to bookmark/favourites

5. pseudo security
right click disable
open page in new window without any menus
disable keyboard short cut keys

we cant rely on it
still we prefer to use it

6. Ajax
Asynchronous Javascript and XML

it is used for asynchrnous commuication between client and server

e.g. google suggest (search)
